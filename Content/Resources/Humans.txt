Hello!

This site is made possible by FunnelWeb, an open source ASP.NET MVC blog 
engine. Our goal is to build a blog engine that .NET bloggers can be proud 
of using.

FunnelWeb started as the personal blog engine of Paul Stovell. With the 
help of Matt Hamilton and Aaron Powell, and contributions from an amazing 
and growing community, we turned it into the amazing little blog engine 
that could. 

We hope you enjoy using FunnelWeb. Find out more at http://funnelweblog.com
